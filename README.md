Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Ambitious software engineer dedicated to mastering full-stack web development and building highly available distributed systems, currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).

My diverse work experiences have equipped me with expertise in the following areas:
- Full-Stack Web Development: TypeScript, React, Redux, Next.js, Express, Node
- Algorithm Visualization: Sorting, Pathfinding, Cellular Automata
- Databases: MongoDB, MySQL, Azure Storage, Presto
- REST API Development: Flask, FastAPI, Express
- Data Visualization: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- MLOps: Machine learning model orchestration and maintenance

I served as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for CS 107 (Data Science Discovery) at UIUC during Spring 2023. My responsibilities included leading bi-weekly lab sessions for 60 undergraduate students from diverse academic backgrounds, developing course materials, hosting office hours, and grading assignments. I am proud to have been recognized on the List of Teachers Ranked as Excellent by their Students in Spring 2023.

Beyond my work, I have interests in algorithm visualization, open-source contribution, and crafting user-centric applications. My portfolio includes sorting and pathfinding algorithm visualizers, substantial contributions to open-source endeavors, and the creation of a personal website that elegantly presents my projects and blog posts.
