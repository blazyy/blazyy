<p>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹</p>

<p>I am an ambitious software engineer with a passion for full-stack web development and large scale distributed systems. Currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, I hold a strong academic record with a GPA of 3.93/4.00. My journey in technology began with a Bachelor's in Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from BSA Crescent Institute of Science and Technology in Chennai, India, where I graduated with a GPA of 9.06/10.00.</p>

<p>My professional experience reflects my commitment to excellence. As a Software Engineer Intern at Graybar in Champaign, Illinois, I lead the frontend development for an internal app rewrite and played a pivotal role in optimizing API efficiency, reducing codebase, and conceptualizing a web application that significantly streamlined quote processing.</p>

<p>Due to my varied work experience, I have experiences in the following:</p>

- Data Structures & Algorithms (LeetCode, Hackerrank)
- FullStack Web Development using TypeScript/React/Redux/Next.js
- Building pretty algorithm visualizers (sorting, pathfinding, cellular automata)
- Database experience in MongoDB/MySQL/Azure Storage/Presto/AWS DynamoDB/AWS RedShift
- Creating REST APIs from scratch in Python & JavaScript (Flask, FastAPI, Express)
- Writing web-crawlers (BeautifulSoup, Selenium) to get data from public websites
- Telling stories with data using visualization libraries (matplotlib, seaborn, folium)
- Predictive analysis using machine learning algorithms (scikit-learn) and neural networks (TensorFlow)
- Machine learning model deployment on Azure (WebApps & WebJobs)
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps)
- Machine Learning model orchestration and maintenance (MLOps)

<p>Beyond my work, I am passionate about algorithm visualization and open-source contributions. I've developed algorithm visualizers and actively contributed to open-source projects. I've even designed a personal website to showcase my projects and blog posts, using Next.js and React.</p>

<p>With a strong academic foundation, hands-on experience, and a dedication to continuous improvement, I am eager to make a meaningful impact in the world of software engineering.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I pursue a variety of hobbies, including but not limited to: weightlifting, cooking, and reading. My guiding principle centers on a daily dedication to self-improvement, echoing the Japanese philosophy of Kaizen.</p>
