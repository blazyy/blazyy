<p>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹</p>

<p>I'm Faaez, a graduate student studying Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I'm passionate about using machine learning to develop large-scale distributed software systems that can make our lives easier.</p>

<p>I'm well-versed in Python for end-to-end machine learning workflows and JavaScript for scalable web application development. I also have experience with databases like MySQL and MongoDB and cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure, AWS, and GCP.</p>

<p>In my previous role as a Software Engineer at Thinkbridge, I facilitated and managed all aspects of machine learning model deployment in a cross-functional 14+ person team. I also designed and implemented a custom machine learning model versioning system that resulted in a significant reduction of monthly hosting costs.</p>

<p>As an intern at Whirldata Labs, I overhauled a data lake querying flow to use Presto instead of MySQL, leading to a 4x increase in performance. I also engineered a sequential metadata generator on AWS that cut down ETL time for data analysts by 90%.</p>

<p>I love working on side projects, like my Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer where I implemented 4 classic pathfinding algorithms and integrated Randomized Depth-First Search to automatically generate mazes. I also contributed to open-source Python repositories by rectifying flaky tests and merging pull requests.</p>

<p>I'm currently seeking internship opportunities where I can contribute my skills and learn from experienced professionals. Feel free to reach out to me at razeenfaaez@gmail.com or connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/faaez-razeen/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
