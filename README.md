<p>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹</p>

<p>I am an ambitious software engineer with a passion for full stack web development and large scale distributed systems. Currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, I hold a strong academic record with a GPA of 3.93/4.00. My journey in technology began with a Bachelor's in Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from BSA Crescent Institute of Science and Technology in Chennai, India, where I graduated with a GPA of 9.06/10.00.</p>

<p>My professional experience reflects my commitment to excellence. As a Software Engineer Intern at Graybar in Champaign, Illinois, I lead the frontend development for an internal app rewrite and played a pivotal role in optimizing API efficiency, reducing codebase, and conceptualizing a web application that significantly streamlined quote processing.</p>

<p>My technical skills encompass a range of programming languages, databases, and cloud platforms, including Python, TypeScript, React, MySQL, MongoDB, Microsoft Azure, AWS, and GCP.</p>

<p>Beyond my work, I am passionate about algorithm visualization and open-source contributions. I've developed algorithm visualizers and actively contributed to open-source projects. I've even designed a personal website to showcase my projects and blog posts, using Next.js and React.</p>

<p>With a strong academic foundation, hands-on experience, and a dedication to continuous improvement, I am eager to make a meaningful impact in the world of software engineering.</p>
